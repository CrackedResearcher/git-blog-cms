# Git-Blogger

A tool built for devs who want to blog directly from GitHub.

**Why pay for CMS tools when GitHub can handle it all—_for free_?**

As ChatGPT would say:

That's where **Git-Blogger** comes in! Haha!

Git-Blogger is a full stack blog framework that lets you create, host, and publish your blog without lifting a finger. No manual deployments. No extra hassle.

### 🚀 How to Set Up Your Blog

1. **Clone this repo** — you'll get a blog template you can tweak as you like. [Clone this repo](https://github.com/CrackedResearcher/sleek-blog-template)
2. **Customize your blog** — make any changes you want to the cloned template.
3. **Important:** **Do NOT modify** the `blog-data.ts` file — it's crucial for Git-Blogger to work properly.
4. **Push the cloned repo** to your GitHub account.
5. **Run Git-Blogger** at [git-blogger.vercel.app](https://git-blogger.vercel.app).
   - It’ll ask for your GitHub username, the new blog repo name, and permission to access your GitHub account.
6. **Configure it** — follow the on-screen instructions.
7. **Done!** Your blog is ready to go.


### 📖 Publishing a Blog Post

- Write your blog like you normally would in the provided MDX editor in Git-Blogger.
- Click **Publish**.
- Git-Blogger will handle the rest. Your post goes live automatically.

### 🌐 Enable Auto Deployments

For seamless updates:

1. Deploy your blog to [Vercel](https://vercel.com).
2. Connect your blog repo to Vercel.

### 🌟 Why Git-Blogger, hmm?

- **It's Kinda Free**: No hosting fees if you're already on GitHub.
- **Simple**: Focus on writing; Git-Blogger handles the rest.
- **Dev-Friendly**: Built with developers in mind. I know how painful it is for devs to have a blog hosted on GitHub, manually typing stuff in Markdown, and then committing changes to the blog repo. This experience sucked—so I built Git-Blogger to automate this whole flow.

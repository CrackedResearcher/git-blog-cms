# Git-Blogger

A tool built for devs who want to blog directly from GitHub.

**Why pay for CMS tools when GitHub can handle it all—_for free_?**

That's where **Git-Blogger** comes in.

Git-Blogger is a full-stack blog framework that lets you create, host, and publish your blog without lifting a finger. No manual deployments. No extra hassle.

### 🌟 Why Git-Blogger, hmm?

- **It's Kinda Free**: No hosting fees if you're already on GitHub.
- **Simple**: Focus on writing; Git-Blogger handles the rest.
- **Dev-Friendly**: Built with developers in mind. I know how painful it is for devs to have a blog hosted on GitHub, manually typing stuff in Markdown, and then committing changes to the blog repo. This experience sucked—so I built Git-Blogger to automate this whole flow.
